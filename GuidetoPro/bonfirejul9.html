    Instead of reading, I decided to hangout with Sammi and Hannah talking and catching up with each other.
    We then decided to make some S'mores in her campfire but not before going to the park and buying supplies.
    I won't lie it was a lot of fun, but afterwards, I had to go home and take a shower because I smelled like campfire
    and smoke.
